## Description

This was the third challenge we will complete for the UofM/edX Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. It was completed to practice our skills with basic JavaScript functions such as variables, functions, while and for loops, arrays, objects, and if/then statements. The actual produced product was a basic employee salary tracker that creates a table on the webpage and more information inside the console.
